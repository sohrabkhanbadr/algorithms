### Subset Sum Problem

The **Subset Sum Problem** is a classic problem in computer science and combinatorial optimization. The problem is defined as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
Given a set of integers and a target sum, determine whether there exists a subset of the given set whose sum is equal to the target sum.

**Formally:**
- **Input:** A set \(S\) of integers \(\{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n\}\) and an integer \(T\) (the target sum).
- **Output:** Determine if there is a subset of \(S\) such that the sum of the elements in the subset equals \(T\). 

### Algorithm to Solve the Subset Sum Problem

The Subset Sum Problem can be solved using various approaches, including a brute force method, dynamic programming, and backtracking. Here, we'll discuss the **Dynamic Programming** approach, which is efficient for this problem.

**Dynamic Programming Approach:**

1. **Define the DP Table:**
   Create a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if there is a subset of the first `i` elements of `S` that sums to `j`, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `dp[0][0]` is `True` because an empty subset always sums to `0`.
   - `dp[i][0]` is `True` for all `i` because a subset with sum `0` can always be achieved by choosing no elements.
   - `dp[0][j]` is `False` for all `j > 0` because a non-empty subset cannot be formed from an empty set.

3. **Fill the DP Table:**
   For each element in the set and each possible sum, update the table based on whether including the element can achieve the target sum.

4. **Result:**
   The value `dp[n][T]` (where `n` is the number of elements in `S`) will be `True` if there is a subset of `S` that sums to `T`, and `False` otherwise.

**Algorithm:**

```python
def subset_sum(S, T):
    n = len(S)
    # Create a DP table
    dp = [[False] * (T + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Initialize the DP table
    for i in range(n + 1):
        dp[i][0] = True  # Sum of 0 is always achievable by choosing no elements
    
    # Fill the DP table
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, T + 1):
            if S[i - 1] <= j:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] or dp[i - 1][j - S[i - 1]]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
    
    # Result
    return dp[n][T]

# Example usage
S = [3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2]
T = 9
result = subset_sum(S, T)
print(f"Is there a subset with sum {T}? {'Yes' if result else 'No'}")
```

### Examples

1. **Example 1:**

   - **Input:** \(S = \{3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2\}\), \(T = 9\)
   - **Explanation:** A subset that sums to 9 is \(\{5, 4\}\). So, the output is `True`.

2. **Example 2:**

   - **Input:** \(S = \{3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2\}\), \(T = 30\)
   - **Explanation:** No subset of these numbers sums to 30. So, the output is `False`.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the dynamic programming approach is \(O(nT)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the set \(S\) and \(T\) is the target sum. The space complexity is also \(O(nT)\) due to the DP table.

This approach is efficient for moderate values of \(T\) and \(n\). For very large values, heuristic or approximate algorithms might be used to handle the problem more practically.
